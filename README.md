# calculator
A calculator program I made when studying software development.

It has all the basic features of a calculator with an advanced mode
allowing more features. A menu bar offers several options and help.

# Build
A gradle build script is inculded. Simply clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/samWson/calculator.git

Alternatively download as a zip file and unzip to the directory of
your choice. Change into the directory, and run the build:

    cd calculator

    gradle build

Run the program from the jar file:

    java -jar build/libs/calculator.jar
